In the realm of Node.js development, the quest for performance optimization is never-ending. One technique that can bring about astonishing enhancements in your applications is multithreading. In this blog post, we'll delve into the journey of implementing multithreading and witness an astounding 6000% performance boost in a Node.js program. Moreover, we'll explore how to run this optimized program via user-friendly API endpoints using Express.js.

## Understanding Multithreading

Multithreading is a computational powerhouse that allows a program to execute multiple threads concurrently, enabling parallel processing of tasks. It's a game-changer, especially when dealing with time-consuming database operations, such as inserting thousands of entries into a PostgreSQL database using the Drizzle ORM.

## Key Components of Multithreading

Let's dissect the crucial components of our code to comprehend how multithreading was seamlessly woven into our Node.js application:

### Worker Threads for Parallelism

To harness the immense power of parallelism, we utilized Node.js's built-in `worker_threads` module. Each worker thread takes responsibility for processing a distinct batch of data. This approach significantly enhances the overall efficiency of our program.

Here's a code snippet demonstrating how we created a dedicated worker thread for each data batch:

```javascript
const { Worker, workerData } = require('worker_threads');

const createPushWorker = (typeOfResource, batchToPush) => new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const worker = new Worker(__filename, {
        workerData: { type: typeOfResource, batch: batchToPush },
    });

    worker.on('message', data => resolve(data));
    worker.on('error', error => reject('An error occurred: ' + error.message));
});

// Usage: createPushWorker('composers', batch);
```

### Data Preparation for Smooth Insertion

Before we dive into the database insertion process, meticulous data preparation is essential. For both composers and works, we meticulously transformed the raw data into a format compatible with the Drizzle ORM. This step ensures that our data is primed for swift and efficient insertion.

### Database Insertion in Worker Threads

The actual insertion of data into the PostgreSQL database was orchestrated within the worker threads. Drizzle ORM served as our trusty tool for these database insertions. The `pushBatchComposers` and `pushBatchWorks` functions were entrusted with the pivotal role of managing the intricate insertion process.

## Exposing the Power Through API Endpoints

To democratize access to our performance-optimized data insertion program, we introduced two user-friendly API endpoints using Express.js. These endpoints allow users to kickstart the data insertion process with ease.

Here's a snippet showcasing how we set up these endpoints:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const { pushAllComposersMultithreaded, pushAllWorksMultithreaded } = require('./your-module'); // Replace with your actual module import

app.get('/push/composers', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const pushed = await pushAllComposersMultithreaded();
        return res.send(pushed + ' composers pushed').status(200);
    } catch (error) {
        console.log(error);
        return res.send(error).status(500);
    }
});

app.get('/push/works', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const pushed = await pushAllWorksMultithreaded();
        return res.send(pushed + ' works pushed').status(200);
    } catch (error) {
        console.log(error);
        return res.send(error).status(500);
    }
});

const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});
```

With these user-friendly endpoints in place, you can effortlessly initiate the data insertion process by making HTTP requests to `/push/composers` and `/push/works`.

## Conclusion: Unleash the Power of Multithreading

In conclusion, the implementation of multithreading in a Node.js program can yield monumental performance enhancements. In our case, we experienced an astonishing 6000% increase in efficiency when inserting data into a PostgreSQL database. By offering the program through Express.js API endpoints, you can conveniently control and execute the process. Multithreading is an invaluable technique that every Node.js developer should consider when aiming for peak performance in their applications.
